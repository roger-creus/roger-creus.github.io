                            My research interests are primarily focused on reinforcement learning and computer vision applied to artificial intelligence. I rely on a solid basis in the mathematical foundations of algebra, calculus, optimization, information theory and machine learning. My long-term research goal is to develop AI systems that sense complex environments and approach unsupervised and self-supervised learning processes in an efficient and generalised manner like we humans do (e.g. embodied AI systems adopting intelligent behaviours by taking advantage of vision and language processing).

                            <p>When building Deep Learning (DL) models, data scientists and software engineers manage the trade-off between their accuracy, or any other suitable success criteria, and their complexity. In an environment with high computational power, a common practice is making the models go deeper by designing more sophisticated architectures. However, in the context of mobile devices, which possess less computational power, keeping complexity under control is a must. </p>

                            <p>Defining a reward function in Reinforcement Learning(RL) is not always possible or very costly. For this reason, there is a great interest in training agents in a task-agnostic manner making use of intrinsic motivations and unsupervised techniques. We hypothesize that RL agents will also benefit from unsupervised pre-trainings with no extrinsic rewards, analogously to how humans mostly learn, especially in the early stages of life.</p>

                            <p>The construction, evolution and usage of complex artificial intelligence (AI) models demand expensive computational resources. While currently available high-performance computing environments support well this complexity, the deployment of AI models in mobile devices, which is an increasing trend, is challenging.  Our objective is to systematically assess the trade-off between accuracy and complexity when deploying complex AI models (e.g. neural networks) to mobile devices, which have an implicit resource limitation.</p>
