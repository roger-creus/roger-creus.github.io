                            I am 22 years old, I am from Barcelona and I graduated in the  <a href = "https://dse.upc.edu/en" target="_blank">BSc in Data Science and Engineering at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)</a> in Barcelona, Spain.
                            I will become a <strong>Research MSc student</strong> at <a href = "https://mila.quebec/en/" target="_blank"> Mila Québec</a> & at <a href = "https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/" target="_blank">University of Montréal</a> starting in Fall 2022. I will be joining the <a href = "https://montrealrobotics.ca/" target="_blank">Robotics and Embodied AI Lab (REAL)</a> under supervision of <a href="https://www.fracturedplane.com/" target="_blank">Professor Glen Berseth</a>.

                            My research interests are primarily focused on <strong>reinforcement learning</strong> and <strong>deep learning</strong>. I rely on a solid basis in the mathematical foundations of algebra, calculus, optimization, information theory and machine learning. My long-term research goal is to develop AI systems that sense complex environments and approach learning processes in an efficient and generalised manner like we humans do (e.g. embodied AI systems like robots in the real world or agents in videogames adopting intelligent behaviours by taking advantage of vision and language processing).

However, previous works still struggle in learning and discovering meaningful skills in high-dimensional state-spaces, such as pixel-spaces.

                            <p>When building Deep Learning (DL) models, data scientists and software engineers manage the trade-off between their accuracy, or any other suitable success criteria, and their complexity. In an environment with high computational power, a common practice is making the models go deeper by designing more sophisticated architectures. However, in the context of mobile devices, which possess less computational power, keeping complexity under control is a must. </p>

                            <p>Defining a reward function in Reinforcement Learning(RL) is not always possible or very costly. For this reason, there is a great interest in training agents in a task-agnostic manner making use of intrinsic motivations and unsupervised techniques. We hypothesize that RL agents will also benefit from unsupervised pre-trainings with no extrinsic rewards, analogously to how humans mostly learn, especially in the early stages of life.</p>

                            <p>The construction, evolution and usage of complex artificial intelligence (AI) models demand expensive computational resources. While currently available high-performance computing environments support well this complexity, the deployment of AI models in mobile devices, which is an increasing trend, is challenging.  Our objective is to systematically assess the trade-off between accuracy and complexity when deploying complex AI models (e.g. neural networks) to mobile devices, which have an implicit resource limitation.</p>

                            <p>In this report we are taking the standardized model proposed by Gebru et al. (2018) for documenting the popular machine translation datasets of the EuroParl (Koehn, 2005) and News-Commentary (Barrault et al., 2019). Within this documentation process, we have adapted the original datasheet to the particular case of data consumers within the Machine Translation area. We are also proposing a repository for collecting the adapted datasheets in this research area. </p>
